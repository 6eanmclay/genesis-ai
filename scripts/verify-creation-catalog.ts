//
//   npx tsx scripts/verify-creation-catalog.ts
//
// ============ WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS =====================================
//
// Sean, on the first real run of the Creation Station against a live Printful
// account: "Printful is connected, but the catalogue could not be read just
// now. It said: Printful creation.catalog failed (400)."
//
// That sentence is itself a defect. Printful sends a body with every 400 saying
// what it objected to, and the call site threw the body away and kept the
// number — so the one fact that diagnoses the problem was read by nobody, and
// the owner was shown a code they can do nothing with.
//
// ============ WHY IT WENT UNNOTICED SO LONG =============================
//
// This is the only Printful v2 caller in the codebase; everything else talks to
// v1 and has run against real accounts since onboarding v2. And it had never
// once executed against a live connection, because the OAuth handoff was broken
// from 19 August until 931de79. Sean's 400 was its first real run.
//
// It was also unreachable by any suite: the request was built inside a closure
// in a `server-only` module. That is why printfulRequest.ts now exists.
